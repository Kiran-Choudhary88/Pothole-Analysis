# Pothole-Analysis
Project for a pothole detection system using Python. In this project i used my skills in data analytics, Python programming, and SQL.

### Project Title: Pothole Detection System Using Python

#### Objective:
To develop a system that detects potholes on roads using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system will analyze images or video frames to identify and classify potholes, providing valuable data for road maintenance.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Python**: For scripting and data processing.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For object detection.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: For storing and querying data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

#### Steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected images of roads with potholes. 

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Used OpenCV to preprocess the images (resizing)).
   - Annotate the images with bounding boxes around potholes using tools like LabelImg.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use a pre-trained YOLO model ( YOLOv4) and fine-tune it on my annotated dataset.
   - Implemented the training script in Python, leveraging libraries like TensorFlow.
   
4. **Pothole Detection**:
   - Develoedp a Python script to load the trained model and perform pothole detection on new images.
   - Used OpenCV to draw bounding boxes around detected potholes and classify their severity (e.g., small, medium, large).

5. **Data Storage and Analysis**:
   - Stored the detection results (image coordinates) in a SQL database.
   - Use SQL queries to analyze the data, such as identifying the most affected areas or the frequency of potholes.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to present the analysis results using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
   - Example visualizations: heatmaps of pothole locations, bar charts of pothole severity distribution.

7. **Reporting**:
   - Generated reports summarizing the findings, including visualizations and insights.
   - Use tools like Jupyter Notebook to document the project and present the results.

#### Code Snippet:
image preprocessing using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('road_image.jpg')

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply Gaussian blur
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

# Edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(blurred, 50, 150)

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Edges', edges)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This project was helped me to apply my data analytics skills to a real-world problem, ability to work with machine learning and image processing.
